Lab 1 Vitis/Vivado Tools installation & Test
Student ID: s84306315

binary2bcd_double_dabble will get 8-bit binary input, then give 8-bit packed BCD outputs(00~99) and 16-bit unpacked BCD outputs(0000~0909).

The testbench should be time-independent, which means that the testing input should be independent of time, it should be an event trigger(in this lab, it's a clock trigger).

Submission includes:
/src - design sources, .v, tb
/report - rtl simulation log, synthesis log/resource, timing report
